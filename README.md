# Zen on 32-bit platform

WIP, doesn't work yet but we aim to build for Windows first (cause Zen is eating too much ram here)

## Building

### Ubuntu

This script is only tested in Google's Firebase Studio instance.

```
sudo apt update
./ubuntu-windows/init.sh
./ubuntu-windows/patch.sh
./ubuntu-windows/build.sh
```

And now :pray: that it works.
